## Languages Used:

HTML and CSS.

## Project Description:

This basic first Portfolio highlights new HTML and advanced CSS skills and understanding that I acquired in the first 2 weeks of Coding Bootcamp.

I used Flexbox properties and media queries to help the website adjust better to different screen sizes with some success, though with more practice and deeper understanding I will be able to make this Portfolio more seamlessly responsive.

## Some of the challenges I faced:

1) The flex property behavior was not always as expected, i think due to my inexperience with how child divs respond to different values of flex justify-content and wrap.

2) Modifying images' and divs' sizes and choosing the best way to do that for a mobile responsive site.

3) I could not, in the time I had, figure out why any attempt at hover effects or putting content into <img> or <a> elements in the work-apps section was unsuccessful.
